🌍 What is Node.js?
Node.js is a program that lets you run JavaScript outside the browser — like on your computer, in the terminal, or on a server.

Normally, JavaScript runs only in web browsers like Chrome or Firefox. But thanks to Node.js, you can use JavaScript to:

Build backend servers

Make command-line tools

Read and write files

Connect to databases

Build APIs and apps (like with Express.js)
