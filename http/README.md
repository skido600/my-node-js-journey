# **Node.js Basic HTTP Server**

Dive into the fundamentals of web serving with this straightforward Node.js project! üöÄ It demonstrates how to set up a simple HTTP server, handle basic routing, and serve static content using Node.js's built-in `http` and `fs` modules. This project is perfect for understanding the core concepts of server-side JavaScript and how a web server processes requests and delivers responses.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Getting this project up and running on your local machine is a breeze! Follow these steps:

*   **Clone the Repository**:
    First, grab a copy of the project files by cloning the repository from GitHub.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/skido600/my-node-js-journey.git
    ```

*   **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    Change into the project's root folder after cloning.

    ```bash
    cd my-node-js-journey/http
    ```

*   **Install Dependencies**:
    While this project uses only built-in Node.js modules, it's good practice to run `npm install` to ensure everything is initialized, especially if you plan to add external libraries later.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

*   **Start the Server**:
    With everything set up, you can now start the HTTP server.

    ```bash
    node http.js
    ```
    You should see a message in your terminal indicating the server is running on port `3001`.

## üöÄ Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the different endpoints in your web browser or with a tool like `curl`.

*   **Access the Home Page**:
    Navigate to the `/home` route to see the default home message.

    ```
    http://localhost:3001/home
    ```
    Expected output in your browser: `this is home page`

*   **Retrieve File Content**:
    Access the `/file` route to view the content of `file.txt`.

    ```
    http://localhost:3001/file
    ```
    Expected output in your browser: `lorem chuks ebisi`

*   **Test 404 Page**:
    Try visiting any other undefined route to see the custom 404 response.

    ```
    http://localhost:3001/some-other-page
    ```
    Expected output in your browser: `404 page`

## ‚ú® Features

This project provides a clear demonstration of several fundamental web server functionalities:

*   **Basic HTTP Server Setup**: Establishes a server instance using Node.js's native `http` module, listening on a specified port.
*   **Route Handling**: Implements simple conditional routing to serve different content based on the incoming request URL (`/home`, `/file`).
*   **Static File Serving**: Demonstrates how to read a local file (`file.txt`) asynchronously and serve its content as an HTTP response.
*   **Custom 404 Error Page**: Provides a fallback response for any routes not explicitly defined, enhancing user experience for invalid requests.
